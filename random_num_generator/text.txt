The time function returns the current time (as a time_t value) in seconds since some
 point (on Unix systems, since midnight UTC January 1, 1970), and it takes one argument,
 a time_t pointer in which the time is stored. Passing NULL as the argument 
causes time to return the time as a normal return value but not store it anywhere else.
